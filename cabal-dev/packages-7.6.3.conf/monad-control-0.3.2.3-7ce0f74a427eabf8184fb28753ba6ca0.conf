synopsis: Lift control operations, like exception catching, through monad transformers
description: This package defines the type class @MonadBaseControl@, a subset of
             @MonadBase@ into which generic control operations such as @catch@ can be
             lifted from @IO@ or any other base monad. Instances are based on monad
             transformers in @MonadTransControl@, which includes all standard monad
             transformers in the @transformers@ library except @ContT@.
             .
             See the @lifted-base@ package which uses @monad-control@ to lift @IO@
             operations from the @base@ library (like @catch@ or @bracket@) into any monad
             that is an instance of @MonadBase@ or @MonadBaseControl@.
             .
             Note that this package is a rewrite of Anders Kaseorg's @monad-peel@
             library. The main difference is that this package provides CPS style operators
             and exploits the @RankNTypes@ and @TypeFamilies@ language extensions to
             simplify and speedup most definitions.
